A Chrome extension that automatically replaces text on web pages. Perfect for adding context to identifiers, fixing common typos, or customizing your browsing experience.

## Why?

My motivation was specifically for annotating identifiers. When you regularly view dozens of static uuids, it can be valuable to add descriptive identifying information. 
e.g. replacing `1234-5678-9012` with `1234-5678-9012 #aws-dev`.

## Features

- **Real-time replacement** - Changes text as pages load and update
- **Smart targeting** - Skips input fields and editable content
- **Lightweight** - Few dependencies; no compilation; efficient performance
