## Why?

My motivation was specifically for annotating identifiers. When you regularly view dozens of identifiers it can be valuable to add valuable information, such as replacing `1234-5678-9012` with `1234-5678-9012 #aws-dev`.

## Features

- **Real-time replacement** - Changes text as pages load and update
